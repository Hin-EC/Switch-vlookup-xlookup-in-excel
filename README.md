# Switch-vlookup-xlookup-in-excel

This project demonstrates how to **insert a new column based on conditions** using different **Excel functions**, specifically `SWITCH`, `VLOOKUP`, and `XLOOKUP`. The dataset used for this project is **"Biggest Hurricanes"**, where I applied these functions to achieve the same result using different approaches.

The project includes **Excel files** with the applied formulas and a step-by-step explanation of the methodology.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked with the following **Excel functions**:

- **SWITCH**: To assign values based on multiple conditions.
- **VLOOKUP**: To search for a value in one column and return a corresponding value from another column.
- **XLOOKUP**: A more flexible alternative to `VLOOKUP`, allowing searches in both directions without needing sorted data.

## Steps Covered

### 1. **Dataset: "Biggest Hurricanes"**
- Loaded the dataset containing information about major hurricanes.

### 2. **Inserting New Columns**
- Created new columns.

### 3. **Using the `SWITCH` Function**
- Applied `SWITCH` to assign specific values depending on conditions without requiring a lookup table.

### 4. **Applying `VLOOKUP`**
- Used `VLOOKUP` to search for values in a reference table and return corresponding results.

### 5. **Using `XLOOKUP`**
- Implemented `XLOOKUP` to achieve the same lookup functionality with more flexibility compared to `VLOOKUP`.
